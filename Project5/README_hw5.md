# hw5.rkt README

## Overview
`hw5.rkt` is a Racket program that extends the exploration of functional programming by introducing error handling and conditional expressions within a custom-defined language, EFAE. The program emphasizes the construction and manipulation of complex expressions and the graceful handling of errors in functional programs.

## Features
- **Custom Language (EFAE)**: Defines a rich language construct that supports numeric operations, function definitions and applications, conditional expressions, and error handling mechanisms.
- **Conditional Expressions**: Introduces `if0` for conditional branching based on the evaluation of expressions.
- **Error Handling**: Incorporates `throw` and `try-catch` constructs for managing errors within EFAE expressions, allowing for more robust and fault-tolerant programming.

## Usage
To work with `hw5.rkt`, load the program in a compatible Racket environment. You can then define and evaluate EFAE expressions, experimenting with its support for functional programming concepts, conditionals, and error handling.

## Conclusion
The `hw5.rkt` program provides a deep dive into the capabilities of Racket for defining custom languages and handling complex programming paradigms such as error management and conditional logic within a functional programming context.
