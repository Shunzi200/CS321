# hw2.rkt README

## Overview
`hw2.rkt` builds upon the foundational concepts of functional programming and DSL design introduced in `hw1.rkt` by integrating conditional expressions into the custom language `fnWAE`. This advancement allows for more complex decision-making and control flow within the language.

## Features
- **Enhanced `fnWAE` Language**: In addition to the features from `hw1.rkt`, `hw2.rkt` introduces the `if0` conditional expression, enabling branching logic based on zero-check conditions.
- **Conditional Expressions**: The `if0` construct allows expressions to evaluate differently based on the condition provided, significantly enhancing the expressiveness of the `fnWAE` language.

## Usage
To work with `hw2.rkt`, load the file into a compatible Racket environment. You can define and evaluate `fnWAE` expressions, utilizing the new `if0` construct to incorporate conditional logic into your expressions.

## Conclusion
The introduction of conditional expressions in `hw2.rkt` marks a significant step in exploring the capabilities of custom DSLs in Racket, highlighting the importance of control flow in programming languages.
