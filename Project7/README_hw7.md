# hw7.rkt README

## Overview
`hw7.rkt` leverages the `plaitypus` dialect of Racket to explore advanced topics in typed functional programming, including type systems, data structures, and type safety. The program defines a custom typed language `TLFAE`, showcasing the application of types in ensuring program correctness and facilitating complex data manipulations.

## Features
- **Typed Language (TLFAE)**: Introduces a richly typed language framework that supports a variety of constructs, including typed numbers, booleans, arithmetic and logical operations, conditional expressions, and more.
- **Advanced Data Structures**: Features typed constructs for working with lists and vectors, including list construction, element access, and vector manipulation operations.
- **Type Safety**: Through the use of `plaitypus`, the program emphasizes the importance of type systems in preventing errors and ensuring program correctness.

## Usage
To engage with `hw7.rkt`, load it in a Racket environment that supports the `plaitypus` dialect. The program offers a platform to experiment with typed expressions and data structures, providing insights into the benefits of type systems in functional programming.

## Conclusion
`hw7.rkt` serves as an educational exploration into the power of type systems within functional programming, demonstrating how types can enhance program reliability, safety, and clarity.
