## Overview
This Racket program, `hw0.rkt`, introduces fundamental concepts of data structures and functional programming using the PLAI dialect. It is structured around the manipulation and analysis of a custom tree data structure.

## Features
- **Custom Tree Data Structure**: Defines a `Tree` type with `positive-leaf`, `negative-leaf`, and `interior-node`, allowing for a variety of tree-based operations.
- **Tree Operations**:
  - `contains?`: Determines if a given target value is present within the tree.
  - `smallest`: Finds the smallest value in the tree, taking into account both positive and negative values.

## Usage
To use the functions defined in `hw0.rkt`, load the file into a Racket environment that supports the PLAI dialect. You can then create `Tree` instances and apply the `contains?` and `smallest` functions to perform operations on these instances.

## Conclusion
`hw0.rkt` serves as an introductory exploration into tree data structures and functional programming principles, demonstrating basic operations like search and minimum value identification within a tree.
