# gc.rkt README

## Overview
`gc.rkt` is a specialized Racket program developed to demonstrate and explore the concepts of garbage collection within the context of the PLAI language framework. It simulates heap management and garbage collection strategies, providing a hands-on approach to understanding how memory is allocated, used, and reclaimed in programming languages.

## Features
- **Heap Simulation**: The program simulates a heap memory model, illustrating how memory is organized and managed.
- **Memory Management Functions**: Includes functions for updating the heap state, and retrieving various heap-related parameters, facilitating a detailed exploration of memory allocation and access patterns.
- **Garbage Collection Concepts**: Through the manipulation and management of the heap, the program delves into the core principles of garbage collection, including the identification and reclamation of unused memory.

## Usage
To engage with `gc.rkt`, load it into a Racket environment that supports the `plai/gc2/collector` dialect. The program allows for experimentation with heap management and garbage collection mechanisms, providing insight into the efficiency and necessity of these processes in programming.

## Conclusion
`gc.rkt` serves as an educational tool for understanding the intricacies of garbage collection, offering a practical demonstration of memory management principles that are crucial for efficient and effective programming.
