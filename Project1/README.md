# hw1.rkt README

## Overview
`hw1.rkt` is a Racket program that delves into the concepts of functional programming, particularly focusing on function definition and application within the PLAI dialect. The program defines a custom language for expressing arithmetic operations and variable bindings, showcasing the flexibility and power of Racket for creating domain-specific languages (DSLs).

## Features
- **Custom Functional Language**: Introduces `fnWAE`, a language construct for defining numbers, arithmetic operations (addition and subtraction), variable bindings (`with`), identifiers, and function applications.
- **Function Definitions**: Uses `FunDef` to define functions, allowing for named function definitions with parameters and body expressions.

## Usage
To utilize `hw1.rkt`, load the file in a Racket environment compatible with the PLAI dialect. You can then experiment with defining and evaluating expressions in the `fnWAE` language, exploring the concepts of variable scope, function definition, and higher-order functions.

## Conclusion
The `hw1.rkt` program provides an insightful look into building and working with a custom DSL in Racket, emphasizing key functional programming paradigms and language design principles.
