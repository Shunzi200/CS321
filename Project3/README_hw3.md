## Overview
`hw3.rkt` advances the exploration of functional programming and DSL design by introducing function definitions and applications, enriching the custom language with the ability to define and invoke functions. This addition facilitates the representation of more complex computational constructs.

## Features
- **Extended Language Constructs**: Expands the custom language with `FNWAE` and `FAE` constructs, incorporating function definitions (`fun`) and application expressions to support complex expressions and computations.
- **Function Definitions and Applications**: Enables the definition of functions and their application, allowing for reusable code blocks and more dynamic programming patterns within the custom language.

## Usage
To use `hw3.rkt`, load it into a Racket environment that supports the PLAI dialect. Explore defining functions and applying them to different expressions, utilizing the expanded capabilities of the custom language to express more sophisticated computational logic.

## Conclusion
With the introduction of function definitions and applications, `hw3.rkt` represents a significant step forward in the study of DSLs in Racket, showcasing the power of functional programming in constructing expressive and reusable code.
