# hw4.rkt README

## Overview
`hw4.rkt` extends the functional programming and DSL design exploration by incorporating stateful constructs such as structures, field access, and modification. This expansion allows the custom language `SFAE` to express a broader range of programming concepts, including state management and sequence operations.

## Features
- **Advanced Language Constructs**: Introduces `struct`, `get`, `set`, and `seqn` constructs to the `SFAE` language, enabling the definition and manipulation of structured data, field-level access and modification, and sequential execution of expressions.
- **Stateful Computations**: These new constructs facilitate the representation of stateful computations within the functional paradigm, enhancing the language's utility for more complex programming scenarios.

## Usage
To work with `hw4.rkt`, load the file in a Racket environment supporting the PLAI dialect. Experiment with defining structured data types, accessing and modifying their fields, and sequencing expressions to explore the new stateful programming capabilities introduced in this homework.

## Conclusion
`hw4.rkt` significantly broadens the capabilities of the custom DSL, introducing stateful programming concepts into the functional programming domain, showcasing the versatility and power of Racket for DSL design.
